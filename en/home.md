The [forgery](https://github.com/ricallinson/forgery) library is a [golang](http://golang.org/) clone of the superb [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) library [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and doesn't pretend to be anything else. As of this moment it's about 90% complete. There are a few minor functions not implemented but most importantly the __URL Routing__ has yet to be written. This said the library works well and as proof [this site](https://github.com/ricallinson/forgery-site) is created with it. Enjoy!

### Web Application Framework for Golang

Forgery is a minimal and flexible [golang](http://golang.org/) web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page web applications.

### APIs

With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and [Stackr](http://gostackr.appspot.com/) middleware at your disposal, creating a robust user-friendly API is quick and easy.

### Performance

Forgery provides a thin layer of features fundamental to any web application, without obscuring features that you know and love in [golang](http://golang.org/).
